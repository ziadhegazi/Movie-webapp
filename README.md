For the past 5 days I have been working to implement what I have been learning the past couple of months, 
and here is the outcome.
In this project I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.
I also implemented my knowledge of APIs to retrieve the top most popular movies dynamically.


---------- CSS----------

I chose to not use any external framework, instead made the webpage responsive and mobile-first design from 
scratch using media queries. The choice of this color theme was chosen to give a contrast between the webpage 
and the movies as well as to make it appealing to the user's eyes.


----------HTML JavaScript React.js----------

for the past two weeks I have been learning React, therefore I have decided to take a break from my continuous 
determination of learning more and test my current skills. I have made few react components and  tried using 
ES6 best practices to achieve that outcome.
